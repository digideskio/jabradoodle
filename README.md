# jabradoodle

Jabradoodle is a jQuery Audio Button (+ üê© ) that makes playing MP3s a walk in the park.


It's still very much a work in progress. Seem some [examples here](http://sjwilliams.github.io/jabradoodle).

TODO:

* Table/block option.
* Loading icon until ready event.
* Document full API, with config object and data-* examples.
